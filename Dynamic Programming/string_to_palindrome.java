
public class string_to_palindrome {
/*

You can use dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. dp[i, j] — minimum number of operations to convert substring s[i..j] into palindrome. Below is the transitions:
Obviously, dp[i, j] = 0 if i >= j
And in general dp[i, j] is minimum of:
dp[i+1, j-1] if s[i] == s[j]
dp[i+1][j-1] + 1 # replace character s[i] to s[j] OR s[j] to s[i]
dp[i+1, j] + 1 # remove i-th character OR insert a new character right after j-th position
dp[i, j-1] + 1 # remove j-th character OR insert a new character right before i-th position
The answer will be stored in dp[0, len(s)-1]
Hope that helps!
